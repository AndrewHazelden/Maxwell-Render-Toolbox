# Tips for hugin
# These tips are translated via gettext.
_("Welcome to Hugin. To create a panorama, just follow the sequence shown in the assistant tab.")
_("If you have a folder with images from different panoramas, you can use the menu File>Search directory for...>Images in PTBatcherGUI to automatically create the appropriate project file, run the assistant and optionally stitch the final panorama.")
_("To run the assistant on a bunch of projects use the batch processor PTBatcherGUI.")
_("To stitch a bunch of projects use the batch processor PTBatcherGUI.")
_("If the horizon of a panorama is wavy, use the straighten function in the preview window to straighten it")
_("The Preview window can be used to center the panorama by clicking with the left mouse button. A right click will rotate the panorama")
_("If you prefer to use an alternative control point detector to Hugin's built-in CPFind, settings are provided in Preferences -> Control Point Detectors.  However you will still have to install those Control Point Detectors separately if you haven't already done so.")
_("Hugin supports a number of third party control point detectors, including Autopano, Autopano-SIFT-C, and Panomatic, via a plug-in mechanism controlled in Preferences -> Control Point Detectors.")
_("Sometimes the control point detector can not find connections between all images. In this case, control points have to be created manually, using the control points tab.")
_("To scroll both the images in the control points tab, hold the shift key while moving the mouse.")
_("The control key or the middle mouse button can be used to pan one image in the control points tab.")
_("Rotating the camera around the entrance pupil (sometimes also called \"nodal point\") avoids parallax errors and makes panorama creation a lot easier.")
_("Tutorials on hugin are available on http://hugin.sf.net/tutorials");
_("If the panorama looks nice but the horizon is curved add vertical control points. See http://hugin.sf.net/tutorials for more information")
_("Horizontal or vertical control point pairs can be set by selecting the same image on both sides of the control points tab.")
_("Control points should be placed on static objects. Avoid placing them people, trees and other moving or deforming objects.")
_("Images can also be added to hugin via drag and drop.")
_("If you like hugin, consider donating at http://sourceforge.net/project/project_donations.php?group_id=77506")
_("Spread control points as far as possible. Close control points do not define the relative orientation between images well.")
_("Place control points on objects as far away from the camera as possible.  They are less prone to parallax error.")
_("The Fine Tune button can be used to find a better position for the point in the right image for an already selected point.")
_("Editing the panorama in multiple layers with The Gimp or Photoshop offers many creative possibilities.")
_("The PanoTools wiki at http://wiki.panotools.org offers comprehensive information about creating panoramas and other images with panotools.");
_("The multilayer tiff file output can be read by The Gimp 2.0 or higher.")
_("You can press the middle mouse button to pan images in the Control Points tab.")
_("The \"f\" key is the shortcut for Fine Tune button.")
_("Pressing \"Del\" will remove the currently selected control point.")
_("Press \"0\" in the control points tab to zoom out to full view.")
_("Press \"1\" in the control points tab to zoom out to 100% view.")
_("After enblend has blended the panorama, the remapped output images (available in the same directory as the panorama image) can be used to retouch the panorama in The Gimp or Photoshop.")
_("Hugin and other Free panoramic software is discussed on the ptx email list. http://groups.google.com/group/hugin-ptx")
_("The Panorama Tools, on which hugin is based, were originally written by Helmut Dersch.")
_("The precision of \"fine tuning\" control points can be improved by enabling rotation search. This is essential for fisheye and wide angle images.")
_("Multiple images can be selected in the image and lens tabs. Commands will act on all selected images.")
_("Lens parameters may vary with changing focus. For best results, calibrate the parameters using know settings and reuse them later.")
_("Optimization of all distortion parameters \"everything\" makes only sense with heavily overlapping images and many well distributed control points.")
