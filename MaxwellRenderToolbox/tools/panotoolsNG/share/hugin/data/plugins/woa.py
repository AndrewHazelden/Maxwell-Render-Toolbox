# This routine is central to the script, and most code up to here serves
# it. The masking of the overlapping regions is non-trivial:
# A proper mathematical description like y=f(x) is only available for
# either of the image margins in coordinates of the image itself, where
# these are trivially horizontals and verticals. When transformed to pano
# space or even to the other image's coordinates, these straight lines become
# curves, and their shape depends on many factors: image size and orientation,
# lens correction coefficients, projection types. The result of all these
# factors can be obtained for a single point at a time with some precision
# by using the panotools transforms, but this all we have. To match the
# curved lines, iterations have to be used, and for some points in the 'other'
# image there may not even exist a valid transform to coordinates of 'this'
# image. I have taken the approach to move only 'inside' 'this' image and
# avoid looking at points 'outside' apart from their status as being 'outside'.
# The resulting code does the trick, but I haven't tested all corner cases -
